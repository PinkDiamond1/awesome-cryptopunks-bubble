A website dedicated to matching CryptoPunks with their celebrity lookalikes. You can find pretty decent matches for Hulk Hogan, John Waters, and, if you’re being generous, Katy Perry in her blue hair days.





## History - CryptoPunks - First Non-Fungible Tokens?

Rare Pepes, another collectible, digital crypto-asset that preceded even the Punks (they are not alt-right memes but rather a more innocent appropriation of Matt Furie's green frog). However, as the ERC-721 white paper points out, they are "not distinguishable assets," but rather a "collection of individual fungible tokens, each of which is tracked by its own smart contract with its own total supply." For the rarest Pepes, that supply is just one.

- The History of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) by Andrew Steinwold (Oct, 2019) <https://medium.com/@Andrew.Steinwold/the-history-of-non-fungible-tokens-nfts-f362ca57ae10>


October 2016 — Rare Pepes on Counterparty
It was only a matter of time before memes started to move to the blockchain. In October of 2016, people began to issue “rare pepes” on the Counterparty platform as assets. A rare pepe is a type of meme featuring this frog character.
These memes have an intense fanbase. There is even a type of meme exchange called the Rare Pepe Meme Directory.

As if being on the Bitcoin blockchain isn’t enough, the Rare Pepe Meme Directory has “experts” that certify the rareness of the pepe memes. Quirkiness aside, this example drives the point home that people want unique digital items.


March 2017 - Rare Pepes on Ethereum
With Ethereum gaining prominence in early 2017, memes started to be traded there as well. In March of 2017, a project by the name of Peperium was announced to be a “decentralized meme marketplace and trading card game (TCG) that allowed anyone to create memes that live eternally on IPFS and Ethereum.” Similar to Counterparty, Peperium also had an associated token, with the ticker symbol of RARE, which was used for meme creation and paying listing fees.

June 2017 — Cryptopunks
As the trading of rare pepes on Ethereum picked up, two “creative technologists” decided to create their own NFT project with a slight twist. John Watkinson and Matt Hall realized they could create unique characters generated on the Ethereum blockchain. Characters would be limited to 10,000 and no two characters would be the same. They called their project Cryptopunks, as a reference to the Cypherpunks who experimented with precursors to Bitcoin in the 1990s.


October 2017 — CryptoKitties
With CryptoKitties NFTs hit the mainstream. CryptoKitties is a blockchain-based virtual game that allows players to adopt, raise, and trade virtual cats. Cats, on a blockchain!
