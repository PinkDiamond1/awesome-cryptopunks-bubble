## History - CryptoPunks - First Non-Fungible Tokens?

Rare Pepes, another collectible, digital crypto-asset that preceded even the Punks (they are not alt-right memes but rather a more innocent appropriation of Matt Furie's green frog). However, as the ERC-721 white paper points out, they are "not distinguishable assets," but rather a "collection of individual fungible tokens, each of which is tracked by its own smart contract with its own total supply." For the rarest Pepes, that supply is just one.

- The History of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) by Andrew Steinwold (Oct, 2019) <https://medium.com/@Andrew.Steinwold/the-history-of-non-fungible-tokens-nfts-f362ca57ae10>


October 2016 — Rare Pepes on Counterparty
It was only a matter of time before memes started to move to the blockchain. In October of 2016, people began to issue “rare pepes” on the Counterparty platform as assets. A rare pepe is a type of meme featuring this frog character.
These memes have an intense fanbase. There is even a type of meme exchange called the Rare Pepe Meme Directory.

As if being on the Bitcoin blockchain isn’t enough, the Rare Pepe Meme Directory has “experts” that certify the rareness of the pepe memes. Quirkiness aside, this example drives the point home that people want unique digital items.


March 2017 - Rare Pepes on Ethereum
With Ethereum gaining prominence in early 2017, memes started to be traded there as well. In March of 2017, a project by the name of Peperium was announced to be a “decentralized meme marketplace and trading card game (TCG) that allowed anyone to create memes that live eternally on IPFS and Ethereum.” Similar to Counterparty, Peperium also had an associated token, with the ticker symbol of RARE, which was used for meme creation and paying listing fees.

June 2017 — Cryptopunks
As the trading of rare pepes on Ethereum picked up, two “creative technologists” decided to create their own NFT project with a slight twist. John Watkinson and Matt Hall realized they could create unique characters generated on the Ethereum blockchain. Characters would be limited to 10,000 and no two characters would be the same. They called their project Cryptopunks, as a reference to the Cypherpunks who experimented with precursors to Bitcoin in the 1990s.


October 2017 — CryptoKitties
With CryptoKitties NFTs hit the mainstream. CryptoKitties is a blockchain-based virtual game that allows players to adopt, raise, and trade virtual cats. Cats, on a blockchain!

History of of non-fungible tokens (2017 – 2020) - Nnon-fungible Tokens (NFTs) Bible @ Open Sea

**Before CryptoKitties (- 0 BC)**
Experiments in NFTs began with the emergence of colored coins on the Bitcoin network. 
Rare Pepes, illustrations of the Pepe the Frog character built on the Bitcoin counterparty system, 
were among the first. Some of them actually sold on eBay, and a set of Rare Pepes 
later sold in a live auction in New York.

The first Ethereum-based NFT experiment was CryptoPunks, 
which consisted of 10,000 unique collectible punks, 
each of which has a set of unique characteristics. 
Built by Larva Labs, CryptoPunks featured an on-chain marketplace 
that could be used with wallets like MetaMask, 
lowering the barrier to entry to interact with NFTs. 
Today, given their limited supply and strong brand among the early adopter community, 
CryptoPunks are likely the best candidates for true digital antiques. 
Additionally, the fact that punks live on the Ethereum network 
makes them interoperable with marketplaces and wallets 
(though slightly less-so than newer assets, as they pre-date the ERC721 standard).


**Birth of CryptoKitties (0 BC)**

CryptoKitties was the first project to take NFTs to the mainstream. 
Launched in late 2017 at the ETH Waterloo hackathon, 
CryptoKitties featured a primitive on-chain game that allowed users 
to breed digital cats together to produce new cats of varying rarity.
"Generation 0" cats were auctioned off in a declining-price Dutch auction, 
and new cats could also be sold on a secondary market.

While some in the gaming community later labeled CryptoKitties "not a real game", 
the team actually did quite a lot to pioneer 
on-chain game mechanics given the design constraints of the blockchain. 
For one, they built an on-chain breeding algorithm, 
hidden inside of a closed-source smart contract that determined the genetic code of a cat 
(which in-turn determined its "cattributes"). The CryptoKitties team even ensured 
the randomness of the breeding through a sophisticated incentive system 
and had the foresight to reserve certain low-ID cats for later use as promotional tools. 
Lastly, they pioneered a Dutch auction contract that later became 
one of the primary price discovery mechanisms for NFTs.

News / Updates / Shitposts about Substrapunks, the first NFTs of the Polkadot
ecosystem. 10 000 unique punks - each 1 a DOT citadel entry https://t.me/substranft


History post ("Hello World" tweet storm) by Substra Punkette - https://twitter.com/SubstraPunk/status/1350480927093358593

In 2020, the Unique Network devs (@usetech_pro) 
created the artist - okay fine, the algo - who drew the Substrapunks, as an homage to Cryptopunks. 

They did this for a @kusamanetwork hackathon - & won! 

But they were more than just a pretty face. 

They were the first NFTs of the polkadot ecosystem. 

Built on Substrate, they benefit from easy customization, interoperability, 
and scalability across the entire Kusama and Polkadot ecosystem. 

Plus, the team built A LOT: 
- an NFT wallet
- A Smart Contract Module
- .NET API connected to Unity SDK PoC
- IPFS 
etc etc. you get the picture. 

Hackathon aside, the team didn't expect their hackathon project to have any value. 
So, just like cryptopunks - they gave them away to anyone who claimed one

Which, eventually, people did. It took a while - not many people believed in $Kusama/ $DOT,
 and even fewer people expected them to ever be worth anything! 

Soon, people started buying and selling them - there was no market,
 people just joined a telegram group. 

Someone eventually made a google sheet to keep track of prices & trades - 
that was v1 of the marketplace! 

No one really knew the value of different traits - most were available for a few dollars, 
but some were already 3 figures.

Surprised by the organic adoption, the team released a marketplace. 
Cross-chain, working escrow, smooth AF.  

As $DOT & $KSM have grown, so has the Substrapunk community. 

Lots of people now build cool stuff for the punks - there are 2 community-built GUIs 

But how do you get your hands on one? 

It's a little complex at the moment, as we're still EARLY. 
The marketplace/wallet etc. are still in beta, and the Ethereum bridge is not finished. 

Ok I'll shut up.  Check out this guide

The #Hackusama Hackathon starts today, June 29th, and runs until August 14th.

As a canary network for Polkadot, Kusama is designed for adventure and taking chances, 
lending itself to a whole host of wild social experiments.

The judges and community have finished evaluating and the winners of #Hackusama are: 

For the Build a Blockchain category: 
First place & Community Choice Trophy:
 Unique Network, a NFT gaming chain, built by 
Alexander Mitrovich & Greg Zaitsev, Usetech, Moscow, Russia

The punks were initially distributed for free in August'2020. 
There were 10,000 punks ever created (Tribute to Cryptopunks in Ethereum)

All punks are purchased and sold in Kusama (KSM) - the native currency of the Kusama Network. 
The Punks are still in Testnet 
and will be moved automatically to the Mainnet once the Unique Network (by Usetech) launches.

What is Kusama?

Kusama is a scalable network of specialized blockchains built using Substrate and nearly the same codebase as Polkadot. The network is an experimental development environment for teams who want to move fast and innovate on Kusama, or prepare for deployment on Polkadot.

Kusama was founded in 2019 by Gavin Wood, founder of Polkadot and co-founder and former CTO of Ethereum.
