## famouscryptopunks.com  (Historic) - No longer online / available?

A website dedicated to matching CryptoPunks with their celebrity lookalikes. You can find pretty decent matches for Hulk Hogan, John Waters, and, if youâ€™re being generous, Katy Perry in her blue hair days.





## History - CryptoPunks - First Non-Fungible Tokens?

Rare Pepes, another collectible, digital crypto-asset that preceded even the Punks (they are not alt-right memes but rather a more innocent appropriation of Matt Furie's green frog). However, as the ERC-721 white paper points out, they are "not distinguishable assets," but rather a "collection of individual fungible tokens, each of which is tracked by its own smart contract with its own total supply." For the rarest Pepes, that supply is just one.
