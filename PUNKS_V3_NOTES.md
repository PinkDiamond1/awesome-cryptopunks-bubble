The V3 Ethos posted on 2/2/2022 by Icymind:

> Launched in June of 2017, the cryptopunks were free for anybody with an ethereum wallet to claim. 
> Enthusiasts quickly jumped on the opportunity and scooped them all up, but there was an error in the source code when making purchases.
>
> Shortly after the bug was discovered, a newer version was released and the V1 claimers
>  were airdropped the cryptopunks we know and love today (at the time of writing, V2)
>
> In early 2022, a resurgence of the V1 contract happened after a developer made 
> a safe wrapping contract that enabled the V1 punks to be traded safely on the open market.
>
> The V1 resurgence sparked debate and controversy causing a divide in the punks community. 
> Many V2 owners were disgruntled, and there is a fierce ongoing information war happening over which contract is more legitimate.
>
> Larva Labs issued a statement denigrating the V1 contract and threatening to dump their 1000 holdings on V1 holders.
>
> With this intense conflict, V1 holders argued the block number 
> and original contract deployment date was already immutably etched on chain as their primary argument for authenticity.
>
> V2 holders pushed back and noted that the stories, community, 
> and official LL stance has already declared the V2 punks as original. 
> The tension has been increasing in the community at the time of writing, and it is likely to continue to grow in the future.
>
> While the V1 and V2 holders continue to argue about historical provenance, 
> a select few members of the punks community got fed up. 
> Icymind, the brains behind the V3 movement noticed this sentiment growing and decided to seize the memes of production.
>
> He quickly spun up the V3 contract and prominent collectors, punk owners, and enthusiasts
>  came together to form the birth of V3.
>
> What does V3 mean, and what does it stand for? 
> V3 is a movement of individuals who believe in looking into the future rather than being trapped in the past.
>
> V3 is an ideology to push the boundaries of Web3 and challenge centralized institutions. 
> V3 is not an official child of larva labs like V1 and V2, but instead a natural, emergent phenomenon that has arisen from the metaverse.
>
> V3s are not concerned about politics. V3s are not obsessed about history. 
> V3s do not care about looking to the left or to the right, V3s only care to look forward.
>
> Finally, V3s don't take themselves too seriously, 
> and will continue to spread the memes of love and positivity for the next 69,420 days.
