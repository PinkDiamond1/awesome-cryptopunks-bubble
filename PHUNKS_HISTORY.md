empties the project wallet, and disappears:

Phunkmaster (July, 20th 2021) in announcements:

> It's been an eventful month since the birth of CryptoPhunks. 
> What started as a parody project has now turned into a movement that represents something much bigger.
> The phunk fam continues to set an example for what a healthy and organic community looks like, 
> one that represents the principles that web3 was built upon. 
> To truly become unstoppable, we must decentralize. 
> To ensure no gatekeepers can stop the forward march of the phunks, 
> the team is handing over full mod responsibilities of our Discord to a group of 
> initial mods: @Confucius , @Strug, @Franklin, and @Traum. 
>
> There's more work to do on phunks, but a centralized team presents a weakness that can be targeted.
> Decentralizing the community is a critical step that adds resilience. 
> Work streams that are already in progress will continue to be pushed 
> from the sidelines (i.e. decentralized marketplaces). 
> We have set the stage for Larva Labs to discuss openly, 
> but regardless of their answer, phunks will live on in the web3 world. 
>
> Your voice is louder than you realize. It's been a pleasure.
>
> Stay phunky, Phunkmaster

November  13, 2021 - Phunks Stolen Through OpenSea Exploit

Although the CryptoPhunks collection had been delisted from OpenSea, 
a back door exploit allowed people to buy Phunks for the last price they were listed for.
Many Phunks were stolen for a small fraction of the floor price at the time.
OpenSea's response was to minimize and bury the existence of the exploit, 
and offer those affected hush money. This exploit still exists today.
OpenSea has done nothing to fix it.
