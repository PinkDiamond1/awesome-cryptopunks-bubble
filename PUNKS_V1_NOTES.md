The welcome message on the (loging required / invite-only) Discord chat server reads:

> Welcome to V1 Punks
>
> Launched in June 2017 by Larva Labs, cryptopunks were originally free for anyone with an ethereum wallet to claim (+ gas).  
> The punks were a huge hit at launch and all of them were claimed incredibly fast.  
> In the original cryptopunks contract, there was a code error that caused ethereum to be allocated to the buyer 
> instead of the seller when a purchase was made. 
> In other words, a buyer was immediately refunded for their purchase and was able to keep the punk.
>
> Not long after the bug was found a newer version of the punks contract (Version 2, V2) 
>  was released and punks were airdropped to this new contract.  
>  V1 punk owners are now able to wrap their punks into an ERC-721 contract 
>  (another kind of standardized contract) and patch over the bug.  
>  This recovery of the original punks contract is a community led and rapidly growing phenomenon
>  consisting of original punk claimant's, [non-fungible] token historians, 
>  digital archeologists and extremely talented developers.  
>  There is no clear leader and all important decisions are voted on by community members.
>
> V1 Punks exist just as V2s do. This cannot be changed or undone since the V1 Punks are a permanent part of the blockchain.  
> The new wrappers impart a slight change to the image in the form of a new background.
>  While this is a very modest change in the image, the core Punk remains the same. 
> 
> While the V1 punks still exist in their original form, so does the existing bug in the V1 contract 
> so NEVER put an unwrapped V1 on sale as you will most likely loose it. 
>  V1 punks are not a derivative but are in fact the "original/classic" cryptopunks. 
>  This is verified on the ethereum blockchain and is immutable.
