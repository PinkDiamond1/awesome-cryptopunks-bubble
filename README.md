**REMINDER: In the digitial world there are no originals! Every copy is a original and you cannot tell the difference
(all 0s and 1s are the same). And, yes, you can always make as many (free) copies as you like (in a free world).
Claiming that you can protect your exclusive rights to pixels because the record of ownership
is stored in a public database is absurd.
Without laws and governments that help you with your rights - the claim is just
a meaningless series of 0s and 1s.  PS: Do you really own CryptoPunks? (Spoiler: No.)
Check your license agreement with LarvaLabs - the pixel art license seller - and do NOT get fooled by the record of ownership.
You are a licensee and NOT an owner.**

# Awesome CryptoPunks Bubble (Anno 2021)  - Modern 24×24 Pixel Crypto Art on the Blockchain


## CryptoPunks, Ethereum Edition

10 000 unique collectible characters with proof of ownership stored on the ethereum blockchain.

![](i/punks-zoom.png)



SPOILER:  You can download all 10 000 CryptoPunks
in a 2400×2400 image (~ 830kb) for free.
See [`punks.png` »](https://github.com/larvalabs/cryptopunks/blob/master/punks.png). Yes, the originals¹!


¹: On the blockchain only
the punk index (e.g. 2890, 8219, and so on)
as an integer number gets stored - and
one time only the "Don't Trust, Verify" SHA256 hash
of the all-10 000-punks-in-one image in the [contract code »](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/contracts/tree/master/punks#constants).



Q: What is a CryptoPunk?

The CryptoPunks are 24×24 pixel art images, generated algorithmically. Most are punky-looking guys and girls, but there are a few rarer types mixed in: Apes, Zombies and even the odd Alien. Every punk has their own profile page that shows their attributes as well as their ownership & for-sale status.

Q: Who's behind CryptoPunk?

[Matt Hall](https://github.com/megamattron) and
[John Watkinson](https://github.com/pents90)
from [Larva Labs](https://github.com/larvalabs) in New York City, United States

> We're coming up on two years of the CryptoPunks launch.
> We thought CryptoPunks might be just a blog post, a couple weeks of
> interest and the end of it - and it's still going strong.
>
> -- Matt Hall ([April, 2019](https://www.artnome.com/news/2019/4/08/autoglyphs-generative-art-born-on-the-blockchain))




Q: How were the punk images created?

With a generator that was programmed to generate punks with a range of features and rarity. For example, there are only 88 Zombie Punks, 24 Apes, 9 Aliens and exactly 1 Alien Punk smoking a pipe.


Q: Is the 24×24 Pixel Art Image stored on the blockchain?

The actual images of the punks are too large to store on the blockchain, so we took a hash of the composite image of all the punks and embeded it into the contract. You can verify that the punks being managed by the ethereum contract are the True Official Genuine CryptoPunks™ by calculating an SHA256 hash on the cryptopunks image
([`punks.png`](i/punks.png) - 2400x2400 - ~830kb) and comparing it to the hash stored in the contract.


<!--
You can generate this hash for the punks image file via a command line tool e.g.

```
$ openssl sha -sha256 punks.png
```

You can use this hash to verify the image file containing all the punks:

``` solidity

> The team didn't expect their hackathon project to have any value. Just like cryptopunks - they gave them away to anyone who claimed one.
>  It took a while. Not many people believed, and even fewer people expected them to ever be worth anything!

>  Soon, people started buying and selling them - there was no market.
>  Someone made an online spreadsheet page to keep track of prices & trades - that was v1 of the marketplace!

10 000 unique character images are generated from a brand new set of face parts.

> To buy a Crypto Punk costs $42,000 and to buy a Binance Punk costs $300. Punks for the people.

## CryptoPhunks Parody - Copyright (or Left) Wars

Phunks face left on the right side of history.

The purpose of CryptoPhunks is to poke fun at the high-brow, pompous group of people that are reflecting the "old-school" rules of art 
into this new frontier of art tokens. 
CryptoPhunks want to test the limits of "parody" and bias against centralized marketplaces, 
of provenance on the blockchain, censorship, while also setting out to unite strangers and collectors from around the space.

And another copyright takedown letter by the million dollar Larva Labs fraudsters. How punk is that?

CryptoPhunks comments:

> The OpenSea [crypto art reseller market] has received a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) [takedown] from Larva Labs. 
> We are witnessing copyright laws unilaterally applied in a [new crypto] world where decentralization 
> and provenance should be paramount. Ironically, Phunks are the real punks in this fight for censorship resistance. History in the making.

>  Dear LaraLabs,

>  Phunks parodied Punks and opened the doors for over 1,000 new owners who learned and enjoyed Punk's history and attributes. 
>  Punks value have also increased during this time. Why are you threatened by Phunks?
> There was never malicious intent in passing off a Phunk as a Punk.

> No one has reportedly been "scammed", because anyone that visited our site knew it was a parody.

And follows-up with an open "Phunk is Punk" letter to Larva Labs:

> In the words of your co-founder Matt Hall, the blockchain "provides a layer of trust that removes the need for lawyers and middlemen." 
> But over the last several weeks, we've seen that your actions speak louder than these words. You have called for lawyers and 
> have ignored our public and private requests for an open dialogue regarding the DMCA issued to OpenSea requesting the delisting of CryptoPhunks.
>
> This letter aims to bring public attention to the issue(s) at hand. During these formative times in the NFT space, 
> CryptoPhunks aims to push boundaries in order to set the foundation for a future 
> where NFTs can leverage blockchain technology for its strengths: provenance and authenticity.
>
> Phunks poked fun at those who were applying the “old-school” rules of art into this new frontier of NFTs. 
> Deceptive and fraudulent copycats should be mitigated, but Phunks has been a clear parody from the start 
> with no reported cases of a user buying a Phunk thinking it was a Punk. In this project’s short lifespan thus far, 
> Phunks have brought in over 1,000 new holders who learned about the Punks’ attributes and history. 
> Some even went on to buy a Punk. Others are just happy to have joined a new and accessible community 
> that embraces the philosophies that web3 was built on.

> Do you believe that Warhol’s iconic Campbell’s Soup Cans and the commentary it generated crossed the line as well?
>
> Additionally, Larva Labs has not addressed their own community’s questions regarding IP ownership of Punks. 
> Do Punk owners have commercial rights to their Punks? Can Punk owners permit the Phunk of their Punk to exist? 
> Is Larva Labs planning to wipe a bunch of altpunk projects off of OpenSea now that they are a $100m+ company? 
> The NFT space, Punk Holders, and Phunk Holders need clarity, collaboration,

## History


CryptoPunk is one of the first "Non-Fungible Token" and was an inspiration for the Ethereum ERC-721 non-fungible token standard
that today powers most crypto art and collectibles on the blockchain.

How much did the punks cost when first released?  You could claim a punk (for "free")
that is, by simply paying the transaction fee of around 11 cents.
Now, you have to buy a punk from someone else and need to pay the market rate.

> With the CryptoPunks, where we gave away 9,000 of them, a large
>  number of them went to a few early people that just got on it and
> automated that process. -- Matt Hall ([April 2019](https://www.artnome.com/news/2019/4/08/autoglyphs-generative-art-born-on-the-blockchain))





**Genesis Story**

> CryptoPunks started with a pixel-art character generator Watkinson
> began playing with in December 2016. It randomly mixed a selection of characteristics (sunglasses, skin colors, hair types, and so on) to come up with 10,000 24-by-24-pixel "punks" - a characterization that nods to the early '90s cypherpunks, cofounded by the late Timothy May. None look exactly alike, and certain types of punks turned out to be rarer than others.
>
> [..]
>
> "We muddled our way through figuring out how an ERC-20
> token would look if it were not fungible," said Hall. After many attempts, they settled on putting the hash of each CryptoPunk's image file into its respective smart contract, including some "marketplace functions" that would allow people to buy and sell the Punks. They posted their project to the Ethereum subreddit and Hacker News and waited for people to notice. Very few did. About 100 claimed a Punk, which Hall and Watkinson offered for free.
>
> Then, in June 2017, the pair got in touch with Mashable and told them about CryptoPunks. "This Ethereum-based project could change how we think about digital art," read the headline above an image of a blond, glasses-wearing Punk with the caption, "Someone owns this picture."
>
> "Things went crazy," said Hall. "We went from having something like 8,600 CryptoPunks available to within 20 hours, they were all claimed." The pair had already reserved 1,000 for themselves "just in case it becomes a thing."
>
> Watkinson got in on the action. The day the Punks exploded, he sold one of his for a dollar. Someone bought it, so he sold another for $10. That sold, too, so he went up to $50, then $100. That same day, someone offered an alien Punk for 10 ether, which at the time was $3,000. "Boom, someone bought that," said Watkinson. "I was just like, whoaaa. The day before that, we were like, will anyone care?"
