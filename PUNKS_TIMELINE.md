## Timeline / Milestones

**June 9th, 2017 - Genesis**

June, 9th 2017 - Minting of CryptoPunks V1 tokens.


**June 17th to 23rd, 2017 - Discovery of a bug in the Contract & Airdrop and Move to CryptoPunks V2**

A critical bug gets reported as token hodlers report that punks offered for sale 
get purchased "for free" with no money changing accounts.

The Larva Lab Bros decide to fix the bug in the V1 contract code 
by uploading a new V2 contract  that includes as a bonus a new bid for punks function / market.

June, 23rd 2017 - Larva Lab Bros airdropped new CryptoPunks V2 tokens to (rightful1) V1 token hodlers.

Note: Trading of V1s continues (safe) over the counter (OTC), that is, "off-chain".

Note 1: The Crypto hacker with the pseudonym Hemba stole tons of V1 tokens (using the buy and get your money back bug).
The Larva Lab Bros honored the token hodlers BEFORE the heist.


**August 2017 to December 2020**

Punk winter is upon us.  Punk trading in low volume and low prices.

Hint: The magic of the zero-fee market that enables wash trading and self-dealing (sell yourself or 
to your parter in crime some punks in ever higher prices) to pump up the market 
and turn low-effort trash 24x24 pixel art into blue chips of the future of digital luxory jewelery / profile pics.
