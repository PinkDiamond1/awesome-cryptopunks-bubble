## Timeline / Milestones

**June 9th, 2017 - Genesis**

June, 9th 2017 - Minting of CryptoPunks V1 tokens.


**June 17th to 23rd, 2017 - Discovery of a bug in the Contract & Airdrop and Move to CryptoPunks V2**

A critical bug gets reported as token hodlers report that punks offered for sale 
get purchased "for free" with no money changing accounts.

The Larva Lab Bros decide to fix the bug in the V1 contract code 
by uploading a new V2 contract  that includes as a bonus a new bid for punks function / market.

June, 23rd 2017 - Larva Lab Bros airdropped new CryptoPunks V2 tokens to (rightful1) V1 token hodlers.

Note: Trading of V1s continues (safe) over the counter (OTC), that is, "off-chain".

Note 1: The Crypto hacker with the pseudonym Hemba stole tons of V1 tokens (using the buy and get your money back bug).
The Larva Lab Bros honored the token hodlers BEFORE the heist.


**August 2017 to December 2020**

Punk winter is upon us.  Punk trading in low volume and low prices.

Hint: The magic of the zero-fee market that enables wash trading and self-dealing (sell yourself or 
to your parter in crime some punks in ever higher prices) to pump up the market 
and turn low-effort trash 24x24 pixel art into blue chips of the future of digital luxory jewelery / profile pics.


**December 2020 to December 2021  - CryptoPunks V2 "Bubble/ Bull" Market **

December, 2020 - Punk #1 purchased (wash trade  / self-dealing?) for U$$ 36 000!

January, 2021 -  Punk #8219 purchased (wash trade / self-dealing ?) for ETH 140!

Punk #2890 purchased for ETH 605 by FlamingoDAO.

March, 2021  - foobardev.eth (0xfoobar) codes a contract that wraps the original V1s
into an ethereum standard [non-fungible] tokens-compatible contract
making buy/sell transactions safe again (if wrapped) and opens the door 
to trading on crypto markets (OpenSea & friends)

Punk #7804 purchased (wash trade / self-dealing?) for ETH 4200

May, 2021 - Christie's $16.9 million record auction (Christies rakes in 5% commision on sale. Congrats!).

June, 2021 - Punk #7532 purchased (wash trade / self-dealing ?) for US$ 11.8 million

OpenSea market delists CryptoPhunks (on request by DMCA takedown send-in by the Larva Labs Bros).

**January 2022 - Revival of CryptoPunks V1**

Between March 2021 and January 2022 original hodlers of the CryptoPunks V1 tokens
stared wrapping the tokens using the wrapper by 0xfoobar   (Punks appeared with a red ribbion on the top left).

Franknft.eth   codes  a new wrapper (or really copies the wrapper from 0xfoobar) and changes the new punk v1 background
to lavender (purple) with no ribbon  AND codes and stars a new zero-fee punk market.

Franknft.eth wrapped CryptoPunks V1 start trading on OpenSea .

**February 2022 - Lavra Labs Bros Self-Destruct Saga**

Lavra Labs Bros sell 39 of the V1s (wrapped first - of course) held since 2017
pulling in about ~$US400 000 and THAN denounce CryptoPunks V1 in a "public service announcment" 
as fraud and worthless.

Lavra Labs Bros force OpenSea again to remove CryptoPunks V1 from trading via another DMCA takedown.

Punks V1 leads hire legal counsel to file a counter notice.  
Trading of V1 continues on zero-fee v1punks.io market and on LooksRare, Rarible & friends.
